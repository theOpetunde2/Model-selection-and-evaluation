## How to select and evaluate models in Machine learning

In this lesson, we will learn how to select machine learning models and evaluate them. First, let's establish our learning goals.

### Learning Goals

 1. Understand the value of model selection and model evaluation
 2. Know the types of model selection
 3. Know the most common model evaluation types and their peculiarities
 4. Understand the ML tradeoffs and when to apply them
 
Now that we have established our learning goals, let's begin!!!
 ### What is model selection?
 Model selection is the process of choosing the best model that works on the test data after evaluation has been done
 ### What is model evaluation?
 Model evaluation is a method of assessing the correctness of the models on test data.

## Types of Model selection
1. Resampling model selection: Talk about the types of Resampling model selection (Random splits, cross-validation, bootstraps) and what use cases are best for each type. (Use a real-life use case)
2. Probabilistic model selection: Talk about the probabilistic types of model selection (Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion) and talk about the real-life use cases for each type.


## Model evaluation

- Talk about types of model evaluation (Classification metrics, regression metrics)

## Types and use-cases for model evaluation

- Talk about the different types of classification and regression metrics

###  Quiz time

A 5-question quiz on model selection and model evaluation


## Bias vs Variance trade-offs
Talk about underfitting and overfitting and how to balance both in real-life cases using the bias-variance tradeoff
